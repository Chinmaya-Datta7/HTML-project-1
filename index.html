                HTML is short for Hyper Text Markup Language. Basically, it's the "code" behind every webpage - even this one. If you're just beginning to learn HTML, let us tell you that it's a fairly easy task. HTML,
                without stvling, can t do anvthing more than setting a lavout, drawing a table, or creating trames - but it is handy as it helps vou structure the content correctly, which is important when vou sit down to add style to your HTML.
              </p>

              <p>
                However simple this might seem, it is a mighty useful tool when it comes to full-fledged web development. Various tools easily eliminate the HTML coding from your work process - but if you want to be in full control of vour web-page. vou'll need to have some command over HTML
              </p>

              <p>
                Through this article, we aim to give you the essential HTML building blocks that 'II help you get up and running. Reading this, you'll be able to understand an HTML source code and even modify it for your
own good!
              </p>

              <h4>Step One - TAGs</h4>

              <img src="https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001485.png" alt="">

              <p>
                Tags are what vou'll see the most when vou look at any HIML source code. A tag can ideally be seen as a wrapper to any item on vour HIML document. Tags tell what magic is to be done on the content enclosed by them.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Let's look at two types of tags:
                <ol>
                  <li>&lt;Stag-example-1&gt;I need a closing tag&lt;tag-example-1&gt;</li>
                  <li>&lt;Stag-example-2&gt;I don't need a closing tag.</li>
                </ol>
              </p>

              <p>
                In the first example. the sentence 1s wrapped by two tags. The first one is called the opening tag and the second one is called the closing tag. Everything in between is attected by the properties of the tag. Ver commonly used examples of such tags are &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;, &lt;body&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;, etc.
              </p>

              <p>
                The second example tags about loner tags - as in, they don't need a closing tag to function. Although it's not required, these type of tags are often written as &lt;tag/&gt; to make the debugging of code easier
                  Common examples of such tags are &lt;hr/&gt; - used for horizontal line. &lt;br/&gt; - to break the line. etc.
              </p>

              <h4>
                  Step Two - HTML, HEAD, and BODY: The three pillars of your document
              </h4>

              <img src="https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001488.jpg" alt="">

              <p>
                  These tags are essential for any HIML document. The parcel out the significant parts of vour HIML code.
                  <ul>
                    <li>&lt;BODY&gt; &lt;/BODY&gt; is placed below your &lt;HEAD&gt; tag, and everything that you want to be displayed on your screen comes under this tag. Text, images, links. your browser live inside this tag.</li>
                    <li>&lt;HTML&gt; &lt;/HTML&gt; wraps vour entire code. Evervthing else in vour HTML document needs to come inside these tags.</li>
                    <li>&lt;HEAD&gt; &lt;/HEAD&gt; includes things like title, styles, and scripts. Head is usually present at the top (hah!), just inside the &lt;HTML&gt; tag.</li>
                  </ul>
              </p>

              <h4>Step three - A few tags that'll make your page pretty</h4>

              <p>
                  Now that vou know how to set up the skeleton of vour document. let's proceed with the things that will go inside vour BODY tag and do some magic!
              </p>

              <p>
                  Some basic text formatting tags:
                  <ul>
                    <li>&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt; makes your text look <b>bold</b></li>
                    <li>&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt; makes vou write in <i>cursive</i></li>
                    <li>&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt; <u>underlines</u> what you just wrote</li>
                  </ul>
              </p>

              <p>For example, this piece of code</p>
              
              <hr>
              
              <p>
                &lt;html&gt; <br>
                <ul><p> 
                  &lt;head&gt; &nbsp;
                  &lt;/head&gt;<br><br>
                  &lt;body&gt;<br>
                  <ul><p>
                      &lt;i&gt; I am iatlics! &lt;/i&gt; &lt;br/&gt;<br>
                      &lt;b&gt; I am bold! &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br/&gt;<br>
                      &lt;u&gt; And me, well, I'm underlined! &lt;/u&gt; &lt;br/&gt;<br>
                  </p></ul>
                  &lt;/body&gt;<br>
                </p></ul>
                &lt;/html&gt;
              </p>

              <hr>
              <br>

              <p>
                  Should produce something like this on your browser: Don't fret too much about the &lt;br/&gt;. It's just for breaking the line so that you can start from the next line. Enter key does little when it comes to changing lines 1 vour HITMIL document.
              </p>

              <p>
                <h5>Tags to help vou structure vour content:</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                      &lt;br/&gt; breaks the line. making vou continue to the next line
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      &lt;p&gt; stands for paragrapn. It divides vour content into paragraons
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>

              <i>Note: You need to use these tags as space and enter keys do very little when it comes to formatting content inside an HTML document.</i>

              <h5>
                  Heading Tags:
              </h5>

              <p>
                  HTML provides you with six tags, from &lt;h1&gt; &lt;/h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt; &lt;/h6&gt; to help you create different sized headers quickly.
              </p>

              <img src="https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001487.png" alt="">

              <h5>Inserting an Image:</h5>

              <p>
                All that's good, but what fun without images on the webpage? Don't worry, &lt;IMG/&gt; to the rescue! The image tag has a mandatory attribute called "source". Basically, it tells the browser where it should look for the image. The syntax goes something like:
              </p>

              <p>
                  &lt; <i>img src = "path_to_your_image" /</i>&gt;
              </p>

              <p>
                  Furthermore, it also has attributes like height and width that let you specify the height and width you want your image to take.
              </p>

              <h5>
                Lists:
              </h5>

              <p>
                  HIML has two types of lists - ordered and unordered. Bach item of your list has to be enclosed in a tag. The syntax for creating a list is fairly simple.
              </p>

              <p>
                  Suppose you want to create a list like:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Item 1</li>
                    <li>Item 2</li>
                    <li>Item 3</li>
                  </ul>
              </p>

              <p>
                  The following code will easily do the job for you:
              </p>

              <hr>

              <p>
                  &lt;ul&gt;<br>
                
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &lt;li&gt; Item 1 &lt;/li&gt;<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &lt;li&gt; Item 2 &lt;/li&gt;<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &lt;li&gt; Item 3 &lt;/li&gt;<br>
                
                  &lt;/ul&gt;
              </p>

              <hr><br>

              <p>
                This, by the way, was an example of an unordered list. For an ordered list, all you need to do is replace &lt;ul&gt; with &lt;ol&gt; and &lt;/ul&gt; with &lt;/ol&gt;.
              </p>

              <p>
                  Let's see what the following code does:
              </p>

              <hr>
              
              <p>
                  &lt;html&gt; <br>
                  <ul><p> 
                    &lt;head&gt; &nbsp;
                    &lt;/head&gt;<br><br>
                    &lt;body&gt;<br>
                    <ul><p>
                        &lt;ul&gt;
                      <ul>
                        <p>
                            &lt;li&gt; I am unordered list's item 1! &lt;/li&gt;<br>
                            &lt;li&gt; I am unordered list's item 2! &lt;/li&gt;<br>
                            &lt;li&gt; I am unordered list's item 3! &lt;/li&gt;<br>
                            &lt;li&gt; I am unordered list's item 4! &lt;/li&gt;<br>
                        </p>
                      </ul>
                      &lt;/ul&gt;
                    </p></ul>

                    <ul><p>
                        &lt;ol&gt;
                      <ul>
                        <p>
                            &lt;li&gt; I am ordered list's item 1! &lt;/li&gt;<br>
                            &lt;li&gt; I am ordered list's item 2! &lt;/li&gt;<br>
                            &lt;li&gt; I am ordered list's item 3! &lt;/li&gt;<br>
                            &lt;li&gt; I am ordered list's item 4! &lt;/li&gt;<br>
                        </p>
                      </ul>
                      &lt;/ol&gt;
                    </p></ul>

                    &lt;/body&gt;<br>
                  </p></ul>
                  &lt;/html&gt;

              <p>
                  All of these tags, when arranged coherently, will provide you with a simple webpage consisting of images, headings, and lists. Further, there are various tags that HIML supports, and we thoroughly recommend vou to check them out and play with them!
              </p>

              <h3>In Conclusion</h3>

              <p>
                  You now know enough to skim through and understand any part of an HTML code. We request vou to go ahead and try skimming through the source code of an website (vou'11 find some tags vou don't know, but that's how vou learn!). Oh, and welcome to the world of web development. With HTML under vour belt, your next stop should be making your page look beautiful using CSS.
